# RMIT-Security-in-Computing-and-IT-PaillierCrypto-Enhancement

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the Paillier Cryptosystem, developed as part of the RMIT University's Security in Computing and IT course. The aim of this project is to provide a clear, optimized, and well-documented version of the Paillier Cryptosystem.

## Features

- Implemented in Java, utilizing the `BigInteger` class for managing large numbers.
- Performs Paillier encryption and decryption.
- The code is divided into clear, single-responsibility methods.
- Adheres to Java Code Conventions and good software engineering practices.
- Comprehensive JavaDoc comments for all methods.

## Usage

The program prompts the user to input the required parameters, including two prime numbers `p` and `q`, an integer `g`, a message `m` to be encrypted, and a random integer `r`.

```bash
Enter the value of 'p' (as Integer):
Enter the value of 'q' (as Integer):
Enter the value of 'g' (as Integer):
Enter the message (as Integer) to encrypt, m :=
Enter the value of 'r' (as Integer):
```
After these inputs are provided, the program will display the decrypted message as output.
